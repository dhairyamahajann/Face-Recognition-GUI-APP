• Imported DLib and Face Recognition libraries for face detection and recognition.
• Used HAAR detection to make bounding boxes with more than 95% accuracy, thus creating annotated datasets to train custom SVM and ANN models.
• Used OpenCV to work with caffe models and prototxt inputs for gender and age detection of custom dataset images.
